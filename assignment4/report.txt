Hash Table algorithm

To find necessary divisor, I used sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding prime numbers.
Other functions are obvious.
In the spellcheck, we just store <string, string> entries in the table. To find one word, it 
consumes at average O(1) time, so very fast. And other part is done as in the problem description
